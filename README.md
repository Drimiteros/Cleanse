# Cleanse 🚮

# 🎯 Overview
###### Cleanse is a free, open-source tool for Windows, focused on clearing leftover files from the directories that tend to silently bloat over time. Cleanse also includes detailed stats and graphs so you can see exactly what was cleaned and how your disk usage changes over time. I’m building it as a minimal, ad-free, bloat-free alternative driven entirely by community feedback. Anyone can suggest features, report issues, or even modify the code themselves — the project is licensed under GNU GPLv3, so the whole thing stays open and transparent.
